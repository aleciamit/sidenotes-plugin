# ðŸŒ¿ Sidenotes Plugin

A clean, local-first Figma plugin for adding and managing rich, persistent notes directly on the canvas.

## Features

- Add color-coded notes with type, author, and timestamp.
- Edit, delete, collapse, and expand notes.
- Filter notes by type and status.
- Export notes as Markdown or CSV.
- Optional AI-powered summarization and action item extraction (future).
- Local-first, privacy-respecting (no cloud dependency).

## Why

Figma's native comment system is powerful but can feel restrictive. Sidenotes provides a designer-friendly, persistent note system directly on your canvas for meetings, reviews, and personal workflows without leaving your flow.

## Installation

For development:
1. Clone this repository.
